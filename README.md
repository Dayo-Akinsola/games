# GameDeal

This is the first web application I made which I used as a final project to complete CS50.

GameDeal is an app that allows you to search for games and check if there are any deals available on a game.

## Tech Used
Python, Flask, SQLite, Jinja, HTML, CSS

The games were collected from the RAWG API and the deals were from IsThereAnyDeal API.
